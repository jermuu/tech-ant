      <h2>Resources and Infrastructure for Execution</h2>
      <p>To fully realize Carrier-ant’s potential, several key resources are needed to support the project’s development and ensure its operational success. These include funding, advanced manufacturing capabilities, and ongoing research and development.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Prototype Refinement</h3>
      <p>Further development is required to optimize the terrain-adaptive chassis and improve motor performance. Testing across varied terrains will help refine key aspects such as stability, durability, and load-bearing capacity.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Advanced 3D Printing Capabilities</h3>
      <p>Investment in mobile 3D printing factories is crucial for supporting Carrier-ant’s modular and localized production model. These factories will allow military units to produce and replace critical parts on-demand in the field, minimizing downtime and reducing dependency on long supply chains.</p>

      <h3>3. Material Research and Development</h3>
      <p>Ongoing research into high-performance polymers and composites will enhance the durability and longevity of Carrier-ant’s 3D-printed components. This research is critical for improving the vehicle’s performance in harsh environments and ensuring its long-term operational success.</p>

      <h3>4. Infrastructure Requirements</h3>
      <p>Carrier-ant requires robust infrastructure to support its manufacturing, testing, and operational needs. This includes establishing field-deployable 3D printing factories, testing facilities for evaluating performance across diverse terrains, and material supply chains for advanced manufacturing processes.</p>
