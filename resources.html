      <h2>Resources and Infrastructure for Carrier-ant</h2>
      <p>Carrier-ant’s development and operational success require key resources and infrastructure. Below are the main areas that support the project's progression.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Prototype Refinement</h3>
      <p>Ongoing work is being done to improve the terrain-adaptive chassis and motor systems. Testing in different terrains will help refine the design, ensuring stability and durability in varied environments.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Advanced 3D Printing Capabilities</h3>
      <p>Investments in mobile 3D printing factories are necessary to support Carrier-ant's localized production model. These facilities enable military units to produce critical components in the field, minimizing downtime and reducing logistical dependencies.</p>

      <h3>3. Material Research and Development</h3>
      <p>Continued research into high-performance polymers and composites is crucial for improving the durability of Carrier-ant’s 3D-printed parts. This ensures the vehicle can perform effectively in harsh conditions and meet the demands of military operations.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Infrastructure Support</h3>
      <p>Carrier-ant requires appropriate infrastructure, such as field-deployable 3D printing stations, testing facilities, and supply chains for raw materials. This infrastructure supports production, maintenance, and testing across multiple environments.</p>
